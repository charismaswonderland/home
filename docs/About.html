    <p><strong>Noreen Nielson</strong></p>
    <p>Iâ€™ve been drawn to the spiritual world since a young age when my family experienced the tragic decline and loss of my darling mother on my 17th birthday. Since then, Iâ€™ve wanted to help and care for peopleâ€¦ I became a hospice RN and have seen
      exactly what youâ€™d expect for one to see: tragedy, triumph, love, hate, regret, appreciation, disdain, hopelessness, and hope.</p>
    <p>One thing that you need to know is that you are human and there is always hope. There is a balance to this life we must all live and the universe which created us is here to heal us as well.</p>
